# blog-application
I wanted to create this basic blog application to learn the fundamentals of web development, the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS) tech stack. I took the initiative to build this during the university mid-semester break. 
## Learned the fundamentals of web development from YouTube and built this website:
- Built single page applications in React, protected and unprotected pages, connecting the React frontend to the ExpressJS server. For protected pages, used JWT (JSON Web Token) to protect certain pages (such as a profile page, create posts, followers/followings) from anonymous users. I deployed the React front-end on Netlify.
- Built the NoSQL databases which was implemented using MongoDB Atlas. Created user and post models to store in the database. I implemented users and followers/followings list so a user can read others' posts. I implemented post CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality so users can perform those functions on their posts. 
- Built and deployed a ExpressJS server on Heroku. The server is the API (Application Programming Interface), which packages the information send from the front-end and sends it to the MongoDB Atlas database. 
- Demo user and password: johnsmith@email.com, johnsmith, larrypage@email.com, larrypage
- From this project I learned a lot about web development and architecture, best practices for software development, the MERN technology stack, how to deploy a website and UI design.
